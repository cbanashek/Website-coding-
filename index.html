    As well, to know a little bit more about the paintng here is a quote from , "The Water Lily Pond captures Monet’s view of his Japanese bridge. While Monet would paint this bridge at various points in time- it can be seen through the blurry lenses of his cataracts in Japanese Bridge– in this version, it is shown bathed in golden light, with a calming color palette of greens and pale pinks.
